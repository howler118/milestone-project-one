# Milestone project one - Union Mills FC

<!--INSERT LINK TO PROJECT-->

Union Mills Football club is football team from the Isle of Man who currently complete in the men's 2nd Division. In addition to football, the club ground becomes a temporary campsite during the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy (TT) motorcycle festival (June) and the Manx Grand Prix (September) as tens of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts come to the island and opt to camp, rather than book hotels (as it is considerably cheaper).

To ensure the club always has a strong squad of players, and that the club stays financially stable, a new website is required to try and attract new players to the club and encourage existsing players to stay as all players pay subscriptions which provides valuable income to the club.

The website also would provide details of the campsite and a form to complete which facilitates booking of a camping lot. The camping provides a signifcant amount of income for the club and so a good website is key to attacting potential campers and making it easy to book a space.

Welcome howler118,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!

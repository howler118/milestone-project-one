        <h1>About the club</h1>
        <div id="history">
            <p>Union Mills were founded in 1920. They were promoted to the top flight (then the First Division) in 1983–84 and stayed in the league just two years until the 1985–86 season. They were again promoted in the 1998–99 season, but, as before, spent just two seasons in the top flight before finishing bottom in 2000–01, winning just two games all season.

Union Mills currently compete in the Premier League. They were promoted to the top flight in the 2005–06 season after winning Division Two. That same season they reached the Woods Cup Final where they lost to Colby 1–0 after extra time. They won the Paul Henry Gold Cup, beating Braddan in the final 5–1. In the 2007–08 season the club finished fifth in the Premier League.

The club has a Reserve team who compete in the Isle of Man Football Combination. They also have a youth system.

On 10 November 2007 former Wimbledon football Robbie Earle visited Union Mills, where he helped coach the club's Under-9's team.

Following the 2007–08 season Union Mills hosted the annual Isle of Man Football Association Awards at the Garey Mooar clubhouse on 27 June 2008.

In the 2011–12 season, Mills had their most successful run in the club's history. They won the Treble by clinching the Division 2 title, Wood's Cup beating Royals 3–1, Paul Henry Cup beating Marown 5–1, and also reached the final of the FA Cup, for the first time in the club's history, where they finished as runners up to Geordies.

In the 2012–13 season, Mills made history again by reaching the Hospital Cup final for the 1st time and ended up being runners up to St Georges. Shortly after this Derek Cowley announced plans to leave the club after 18 successful years in charge, his assistant Darren Scarffe also left the club.

On 16 June 2013 it was announced that Chris Cain would take over as being the new Union Mills manager.

In July 2018 Steven Fox was announced as Union Mills Manager
